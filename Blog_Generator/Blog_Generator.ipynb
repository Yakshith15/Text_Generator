              "\"Attack on titan is the peak of anime. It's the pinnacle of the genre, and it's also one of my favorite shows of all time. I'm not going to lie to you, this show is not for everyone, but if you're looking for a show that will make you laugh and cry at the same time, then you need to check this one out.\\n\\nIf you haven't seen the show yet, I highly recommend you do so. If you've seen it, you'll know what I mean. This show has a lot of things going for it that make it stand out from the crowd. For one thing, it has an amazing cast of characters. The main characters are all very likable and relatable. They all have their own quirks and quirks that you can relate to. There are also a ton of side characters that pop up throughout the series. Some of them are just there to add a little more depth to the story, while others are there just to be there for the sake of being there. All in all, the cast is very well done and makes for an enjoyable experience.\\n\\n\\nOne thing that I really like about this anime is that it doesn't take itself too seriously. While it does have some serious moments, they're not over the top or anything like that. In fact, there are a few moments that are very lighthearted and fun to watch. One of those moments is when the main character is trying to get a girl to like him, which is a very cute moment. Another moment that's a bit more serious is during the final battle with the titans. During that battle, we get to see how the characters deal with their loss and what it means to them in the long run. That's not to say that the anime isn't serious, because it definitely is. However, when it comes down to it and you have to make a choice between saving the world or saving your own life, do you really want to do the latter? I don't think so, especially when you consider the fact that this is an anime about a group of people who are forced to choose between their lives and the lives of their friends and family. You can't really blame them for making that choice, right? The anime does a great job of making you care about these characters and making them feel like real people, instead of just cardboard cutouts for you to laugh at and make fun of. Even when they do make that\""
